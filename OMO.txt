This is me trying to make my own repository without help.

Okay so I have made a local repository in a new folder OMO 
which stands for On My Own. 

Now I'm making changes to see if I can have Git track them.

Ok so here's the second change I have made to this document. 
Thus far I'm doing well.

Okay so I'm going to try and make another change and upload 
these changes onto the remote repository.

Ok so apparently whenever I tried to git push my data from my 
git init to the remote repository, a warning would appear:
LF will be replaced by CRLF in git

When you get code from git that was uploaded from a uniz system 
they will only have a LF (line feed). CRLF stands for carriage 
return life feed. If you want this warning off, type the 
following command line in git
git config core.autocrlf true
