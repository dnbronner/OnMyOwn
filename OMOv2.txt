This is me trying to make my own repository without help.

Okay so I have made a local repository in a new folder OMO 
which stands for On My Own. 

Now I'm making changes to see if I can have Git track them.

Ok so here's the second change I have made to this document. 
Thus far I'm doing well.

Okay so I'm going to try and make another change and upload 
these changes onto the remote repository.

Sitting here with the HUSBAND...he is very handsome.
